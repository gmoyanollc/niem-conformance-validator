## niem-conformance-validator

niem-conformance-validator is a single-purposed component that assesses the NIEM 3.0 conformance of XML Schema.  The only run requirement is to have an installation of [ <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Ant</a> ].  With Ant and/or Maven, add niem-conformance-validator to build and test automation, or run it ad-hoc from the command-line when an IDE slows you down.

The default Ant Task "validate-niem-conformance" produces a report.  The report contains a table with XPATH instructions to data objects that failed assertions.  The report also contains a list of all the assertions applied to the XML Schema file.

Open the Ant build.xml file for more details.

Included with this component are the following:

*  [ <a href="https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/3.0/NIEM-NDR-3.0-2014-07-31.html" target="_blank">NIEM NDR 3.0 Schematron</a> ]

*  [ <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/products/products.xml" target="_blank">Saxon-HE</a> ], an XSL Transformer, and

*  an XSL reference implementation of [ <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19757:-3:ed-2:v1:en" target="_blank">Rule-based validation â€” Schematron (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2016)</a> ], as proposed in 2010.  

How to get started
------------------
1. [git-clone] (https://git-scm.com) this repository to a folder for projects:

        cd dev-project
        git clone https://github.com/gmoyanollc/niem-conformance-validator
    
    Expected result:
    
        .
        `-- niem-conformance-validator
            `-- external
                |-- iso-schematron-xslt2
                |-- niem-ndr
                `-- saxon
    
2. Test the configuration for Ant and Saxon:   

        cd niem-conformance-validator
        ant test-config -lib ./external/saxon/SaxonHE9-7-0-1J/saxon9he.jar
        
    Expected result:
    
        ...
        BUILD SUCCESSFUL
        ...
        
3. Run and validate an XML Schema folder by providing its folder path as a value to the Ant Property 'xml-to-validate.dir':

    Example command-line:
      
      ant -Dxml-to-validate.dir="/project/src/main/resources/iep-schema/extension" -lib ./external/saxon/SaxonHE9-7-0-1J/saxon9he.jar
      
    Expected result:
    
        ...
        BUILD SUCCESSFUL
        ...
