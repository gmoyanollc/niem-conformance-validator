# niem-conformance-validator

niem-conformance-validator is a single-purposed component for assessing the NIEM 3.0 conformance of XML Schema.  

## requirements
niem-conformance-validator requires [ <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Ant</a> ].  Ant is free and runs on any Java-enabled operating system.  Either install it directly for command-line operations or look for support in popular development and build tools such as Eclipse, Visual Studio, Maven, Gradle, and others.

## function
niem-conformance-validator takes XML Schema as input and produces a NIEM Conformance report as output.

    /------------------\    /----------------------------------------------\
    |  [ xml-schema ]  |    |  "ndr-rules-conformance-target-ext.sch.xsl"  |
    \------------------/    \----------------------------------------------/
                  \              /
                   |             |
                   V             V
            /--------------------------\
           /   [ xsl-transformations ]  \
           \----------------------------/
                         |
                         V
            /---------------------------\
            |  [ xml-schema.svrl.html ]  |
            \---------------------------/
                             
The report contains a table with XPATH instructions to objects that failed assertions, followed by a list of all assertions.

The default Ant Task is "validate-niem-conformance", which produces the report.  Open the Ant build.xml file for more details.

## what's included
niem-conformance-validator includes the following components:

*  [ <a href="https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/3.0/NIEM-NDR-3.0-2014-07-31.html" target="_blank">NIEM NDR 3.0 Schematron</a> ]

*  [ <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/products/products.xml" target="_blank">Saxon-HE</a> ], an XSL Transformer, and

*  an XSL reference implementation of [ <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19757:-3:ed-2:v1:en" target="_blank">Rule-based validation â€” Schematron (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2016)</a> ], as proposed in 2010.  

##get started
1. Expand or [git-clone] (https://git-scm.com) to a folder for projects:

        cd dev-project        
        unzip niem-conformance-validator.zip
        
			or
			
        git clone https://github.com/gmoyanollc/niem-conformance-validator
    
    Expected result:
    
        .
        `-- niem-conformance-validator
            `-- external
                |-- iso-schematron-xslt2
                |-- niem-ndr
                `-- saxon
    
2. Test the configuration for Ant and Saxon:   

        cd niem-conformance-validator
        ant test-config -lib ./external/saxon/SaxonHE9-7-0-1J/saxon9he.jar
        
    Expected result:
    
        ...
        BUILD SUCCESSFUL
        ...
        
3. Run and validate an XML Schema folder by providing its folder path as a value to the Ant Property 'xml-to-validate.dir':

    Example command-line:
      
      ant -Dxml-to-validate.dir="/project/src/main/resources/iep-schema/extension" -lib ./external/saxon/SaxonHE9-7-0-1J/saxon9he.jar
      
    Expected result:
    
        ...
        BUILD SUCCESSFUL
        ...
